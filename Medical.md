## Introduction to Advanced Medical Training
<a id="intro"></a>
<!-- to be changed -->
Welcome to the Catterick Garrison School of Field Medicine. Thank you for your interest in becoming a UKSF Medic. All of us in the team hope that you will become a valued member of 1Para-Medics!

Becoming a Medic requires a deeper and broader understanding of the current ACE Medical system. There is a separate document detailing the full details of the mod: http://ace3mod.com/wiki/feature/medical-system.html. However the document you are now reading is specific to UKSF Operations, and will use our specific procedures. Some information will be repeated here for your convenience. That said, do study it in detail, as it will help you to understand the current limitations of the mod (i.e. No broken bones at the moment, Surgery kit not properly implemented, etc.).

Why do you need this deeper knowledge? Well, because getting your morphine dosage wrong can kill your patient. So can Epinephrine. Oh, so can tourniquets. And probably everything else. With our help, you will soon know everything you need to keep your guys alive and in the fight. And trust us, everyone loves an efficient Medic.

So welcome aboard! Don't be frightened off by all the technical stuff that you might see. Most of what you will learn will be practically taught as well as being in here, so you'll have plenty of chances to learn by doing.

## Training Schedule
<a id="training"></a>
<!-- to be changed -->
Advanced Medical Phase 1:

Intro to ACE: "Hey, what button do I press again?"
The Medic's Role: The importance of your own positioning, treating in secured positions, Medevac preparations (troops standing by to move CAS to the chopper), Man management.
Triage for Medics: Who to treat first and why! Also important: knowing what the Soldiers will do with a casualty.

Advanced Medical Phase 2:

- Equipment Orientation - Different types of bandages and drugs. 
- Medical Knowledge - Types of injury, what to use and when.

Advanced Medical Phase 3:

- Practical - Valuable field knowledge.

Advanced Medical Phase 4:

- Assessment - Running your own Phase 3 with observation from a Senior Medic.

Advanced Medical Phase 5:

-Final Test: You will be Medic on an official Saturday Operation, under observation of a Senior Medic.
At this stage, the candidate should have an understanding of both ACE and UKSF Procedures to the level that they can:
- Act independently with no prompts
- Request supplies
- Prep casualties for medevac.

Once completed, you will be a qualified Medic.

## Types of Wounds
<a id="wounds"></a>

Below there is a reference list of the wounds, along with the best bandage(s) for healing it. A more detailed description of the uses of different bandages will follow. Knowing the right bandage for the job will ensure that it stays in place for longer, and reducing both your future workload, and the time the casualty is out of the fight.

|Wound|Source|Bleeding|Bandage|
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
|Abrasions|falling, vehicle crashes|Slow|packing/elastic|Fast|Avulsions|explosions, vehicle crashes, grenades, artillery shells, bullets, backblast|extremely fast|packing|
|Contusions|bullets, back blast, punches, vehicle crashes, falling.|None|packing/elastic|
|Crush|falling, vehicle crashes|Slow|elastic|
|Cut|vehicle crashes, grenades, explosions, artillery shells, back blast|Fast/Slow|elastic|
|Lacerations|vehicle crashes|Medium|elastic|
|Velocity|bullets, grenades, explosions|Fast/Slow|packing|
|Puncture|Grenades|Medium|elastic|

## Injectors
<a id="injectors"></a>
|Injector|Effect|
| -------- | ------- |
| Morphine | Relieves Pain, Lowers HR(75), Lowers BP |
| Epinephrine | Increases HR, Increases conciousness attempts |

## Heart Rate
<a id="hr"></a>
<!-- to be refined -->

Heart Rate:

If the casualty's heart rate gets too high or low, they can pass out, and ultimately die. Administering medication will have a direct influence over the heart rate, and incorrectly balanced can quickly incapacitate or kill them.
Morphine will lower the heart rate, and with the current state of ACE almost always needs to be quickly followed up by a dose of Epinephrine. If not, you will soon have a bunch of guys moaning about hearing their heart pounding in their ears. Managing your medical supplies is one of the challenges of being a Medic!

Safe Heart Rate = 80
Dangerously Low Heart Rate = 50
Dangerously High Heart Rate = 140 

Any casualty with a Heart Rate in one of the dangerous categories risks passing out.
Any casualty with a Critical Heart Rate also risks death.

## Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR):
<a id="cpr"></a>
<!-- to be refined -->

If a casualty's Heart Rate drops to 0, you will be given the option to perform CPR on their torso. This is a compression of the chest to attempt to restart the beating of the heart. This may need to be repeated multiple times, and unless the cause of the problem is treated the casualty's heart will likely stop again.

## Blood Pressure (BP) and Transfusions
<a id="bp"></a>
<!-- to be refined -->

When the player is wounded and bleeding, his blood pressure will drop. The larger and more numerous the wounds, the quicker the pressure will fall.

Ideal blood pressure is 120/80 (said "one twenty over eighty")
The lowest possible pressure is 0/0. This is a Critical situation, and will quickly kill the casualty. Any casualty reaching this low a BP will almost certainly need to be Medevac’d.

BP is restored by administering IVs of Saline, Blood, and Plasma. There are 3 different sizes of IV bags: 250ml, 500ml and 1000ml. Transfusing 250ml takes about 1 minute to complete.
This should only be carried out when the area is safe i.e. taking no enemy contact onto your position.

## Personal Aid Kit (and Surgery Kit)
<a id="pak"></a>

### Personal Aid Kit
Used to fully heal someone. (Removes any injury, restore vitals to a stable state and reset the medical history, clears all medication in the system.)
Its use may be limited to a certain class and / or near a vehicle / facility.
Its use can also be limited according to the condition of the patient; you might need to stabilize him first before using it.

### Surgical kit
Is only useful when advanced wounds’ (reopening) is enabled.
Stitch a wound to stop it from reopening.
Its use may be limited to a certain class and / or near a vehicle / facility.
Its use can also be limited according to the condition of the patient; you might need to stabilize him first before using it.

## Ambulance and Hospital
<a id="base"></a>
The Ambulance is most often used with convoy Ops. You will be able to make use of a PAK or a Surgical Kit inside it, as long as the casualty is also inside. If they are not conscious, you'll need to drag them in yourself (or use a nearby rifleman to do it for you.)

We use an Ambulance when we need to use a Personal Aid Kit or a Surgical Kit. The hospital is back at base. To get to the hospital will require a medevac.

## Medevac Procedure
<a id="medevac"></a>
If it is determined that after treatment in a secure area casualties need MEDEVAC, the first thing is to ask the Pl Sgt to organize it. If required, move to the MEDEVAC LZ and wait for the chopper. If there are multiple casualties you should task rifleman to help you move the casualties. 

Once the chopper has begun its ‘run in’ to the LZ, ensure you and/or the riflemen have the casualties on their backs ready to move to the Helo. The MEDEVAC must NOT be on the ground for a longer than ONE minute. This is absolutely vital. If you’re not achieving this, you’re failing the ‘man management’ side of being a medic. 

## Phase 3
<a id="phase3"></a>

The following is what you will use to teach Triage to new recruits in Phase 3 of their training. It is also important for you to know the Tiers as they will let you know how urgently your attention is needed.

### Triage Tiers:

When reporting a casualty, the following terms should be used to quickly inform of the severity of the situation.

#### T1 - The casualty is in Critical condition and needs a Medic ASAP (likely unconscious with several wounds).
#### T2 - The casualty is Non-Critical but still needs a Medic (unconscious but stable / conscious unable to treat injuries).
#### T3 - The casualty requires pain relief only. (Or Epi, if they haven’t followed procedure.)
#### T4 - The casualty is KIA.

### Map markers
CCP - Where injury was inflicted
R(reaper) markers

### How to deal with a casualty

First Priority / Step 0
When someone is injured your first priority is your own safety. This is critical.

#### Step 1
Report to your Section Leader that there is a 'Man down', with their name if you know it. Your IC will decide whether it is safe to move to the casualty. If it is risky, they will never send the medic first! 

#### Step 2
If you’re the first to get to the casualty, analyze the extent of the injury. If there are a lot of wounds start enither applying a tourniquets to limbs or start bandaging.

#### Step 3
Once the casualty is stable, move the casualty to the medic. There should be friendlies around to cover you whilst doing so. The medic will be in a secure position normally marked on the map with a R- marker.

#### Step 4
When you get to the medic / the medic arrives, explain the injuries (what happened) and what you have done (bandage/tourniquet) and ask if they need any help. If no help is required, then cover the medic. DO NOT move back to your position until instructed by the medic. 

#### Do's and Dont’s

Do: -

Diagnose yourself to aid the medic if possible, communicate your injuries (in general i.e. left arm, right leg) clearly and concisely. Assign yourself a Triage Tier.
If there is no Medic available soon, or you are critically injured, do bandage yourself, and let your Section Leader 2IC know that you are doing so.
Inform your section leader / 2IC that you are hit using your name. No-one knows who "I'm" is!

Don’t: -

Stop firing just because you’ve been hit, the medic WILL get to you. If you’re able to shoot, shoot! Protection must be considered at all times, and winning the firefight should always be your priority.
Administer any drugs to yourself without clearance from a Medic.
If the medic is busy with a more critical casualty, don't hassle him to heal you, and don't cluster around him.

Don’t take any additional medical supplies unless told to by your Section Leader, 2IC, or the Medic.
DO NOT MOVE when the Medic is healing you, you will slow the whole process down!

## Combat Medic
<a id="combat"></a>
### Medical Equipment List

As a combat medic you are expected to carry a similar kit to a Reaper callsign but on a much smaller scale.

|  Item    | Amount  |
| -------- | ------- |
| Elastic Bandages  | 40    |
| Packing Bandages | 20     |
| Morphine Injectors  | 10    |
| Epinephrine Injectors | 10     |
| 500ml Blood Bags    | 15    |
| Surgical Kit  | 1    |
| Splints | 8     |
| Tourniquets    | 8    |
| Painkillers  | 5    |
| Pen Torch | 1    |
| Extra Bandages    | More if required    |


If you run out of any of these supplies throughout the op inform your 2iC similarly to how you would If you run out of ammo.
Medication
The three types of medication you will use as a combat medic are morphine, epinephrine and adenosine.
Morphine
Morphine is used to lower heart rate as well as treat pain however the pain treatment functionality is not its main function. It is not to be used solely as treatment for pain.

### Morphine
Significantly reduces heart rate. This will normally fall to 74 BPM. Monitor this after 5 minutes.

### Epinephrine
To raise the heart rate use epinephrine. Once a Tier 1 is stable it should be administered to speed up the revival process.

---------------------------
If HR is >110 use Morphine

If HR is <95 let it recover

If HR is <65 use Epinephrine

If HR is >65 let it recover

----------------------------

## Bandage Types
There are two main bandage types that you will use - Packing and elastic. Each bandage lasts a different amount of time depending on the wound.

### Packing Bandage
Used to pack open wounds, The packing material soaks up any drainage from the wound.

### Elastic Bandage
An elastic bandage is a stretchable bandage used to create localized pressure on a wound.


## Bandage Effectiveness
The table below outlines what bandage is suited for each wound.


| Wound type| Packing | Elastic |
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: |
| Abrasions|V.High|High|
| Avulsions |V.High|V.Low|
| Contusions|High|V.High|
| Crush|Low|V.High|
| Cut|V.Low|V.High|
| Lacerations|V.Low|V.High|
| Velocity|V.High|Low|
| Puncture|V.Low|High|

### Tourniquets
Used to quickly stop a limb from bleeding. After 5 minutes the casualty will experience pain and will alter HR. Remove tournequet as soon as limb is stitched. You can use blood and injectors on a limb even if other limbs are touniqueted. You are unable to check HR on a limb with tourniquet.

### Splints
Used on broken/fractured limbs from falls or vehicles collisions.

### Painkillers
Used for a slow pain relief to be used on small or medium levels of pain, anything higher use morphine.

As pain killers work similarly to morphine in this current version, ensure to check HR and BP for sudden drops and check again after 5 minutes.

### Surgical Kit
Used to stitch bandaged wounds. 

### Pen torch
Used to Check pupil dilation.

'Pupils dialating normally' = Keep working on them.

'Pupils mostly dialated' = Casulty is coma and in need of medevac.


## How to treat a tier 1 
<!-- to be changed -->
The first priority with a tier 1 is to stop the bleeding. If the casualty is heavily wounded you will need to tourniquet limbs that are bleeding. bandage head then torso as required and then start bandaging the limbs. Once you have bandaged the casualty you next want to stitch them to stop the wounds reopening. Once you have stabilised the casualty with all wounds stitched remove ALL torniquetes. 

If the casualty has no heart rate: 

If the casualty has lost blood you will want to administer blood. If the ace medical menu states the casualty has lost either a fatal amount or a large amount CPR will not work until it has gone above that point. Once enough blood has been replenished start CPR. CPR may not work the first time just ensure to check the heart rate immediately after CPR. 

IMPORTANT: If you check the heart rate whilst CPR is being performed it will show as the casualty having a heart rate. 

If the casualty has a heart rate:
	
If the casualty has lost blood you will want to administer blood.

Once you have got a heart rate and the ace medical menu is no longer showing that the casualty has lost a large amount of blood, start managing the heart rate. 

If the heart rate is over 110bpm use Morphine
If HR is between 80bpm and 95bpm let it recover
If HR is less than 75bpm use Epinephrine
If HR is between 75bpm and 110bpm let it recover

Once the heart rate reaches a stable level the casualty should eventually wake up If the casualty doesn’t wake up even though vitals are stable use epinephrine.

Once the casualty is awake you will then be able to deal with the pain if they have any. 

If the casualty has been down for an extended period of time check the pupil dilation with a pen torch. If the result is anything other than ‘pupils constrict normally’ then they will need a medevac. 

Your call sign as a combat medic for radio communications on channel 8 will be 
Reaper {Call sign Number} Bravo.

Radio etiquette 
The radio etiquette for the Reaper net is the same as all other radio channels as per your IBRU training.
